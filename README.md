# Dodgeball
2D simulation of a 2-player dodgeball game in Python to be played by 2 players on a single computer. Player 1 is on the left side and Player 2 is on the right side.
The goal is to get to 3 points. If player 1 throws the ball and hits player 2, player 1 gets a point. If player 2 catches it, player 2 gets a point. And vice versa. Then, the ball
appears at a random point in the middle at a random time.

Player 1 controls: Moving- WASD, to hold the ball- hold Q down while overlapping the ball, to throw the ball- hold down Q and Z down while overlapping the ball until the arrow, which
controls the direction of the ball, is where you want it. Then, let go of both keys and press X when the power meter, which controls how fast and far the ball goes, is where you want it. 
To catch a ball- hold X (not for too long or catching will be disabled for a short time)

Player 2 controls: Moving- arrow keys, to hold the ball- hold P down while overlapping the ball, to throw the ball- hold down P and L down while overlapping the ball until the arrow, which
controls the direction of the ball, is where you want it. Then, let go of both keys and press m when the power meter, which controls how fast and far the ball goes, is where you want it. 
To catch a ball- hold R-shift (not for too long or catching will be disabled for a short time).
